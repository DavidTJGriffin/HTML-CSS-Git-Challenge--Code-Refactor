# <Your-Project-Title>
## Description
- The motivation behind creating this project was to refactor code to meet accessibility standards, improve code-readability, and consolidate code. 

- This website was built to create an example of code that meets accessibility standards by adding alt attributes to images, using semantic html elements to improve the code-readability, and consolidating css rules to use less lines of code from using well-defined selectors. 

- This project solved the problem of a website with unorganized code by organizing the code by creating alt attributes to images, organizational-comments within the code, semantic html elements, and consolidated css rules. 

- I learned that the way in which code is structured is a significant factor when working with the code. Using semantic html, creating comments, consolidating code, and using alt attributes for images are very important. These practices are for the purpose of meeting accessibility standards, and improving apps.
